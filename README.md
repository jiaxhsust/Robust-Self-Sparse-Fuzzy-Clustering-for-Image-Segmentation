# RSSFCA
Our paper “Robust Self-Sparse Fuzzy Clustering for Image Segmentation” has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access. 2020. 

The proposed RSSFCA has two advantages:
1.	The RSSFCA utilizes regularization under Gaussian metric to obtain proper sparse memberships that can effectively reduce non-homogenous interference and achieve better classification than popular self-optimized FCM algorithms.
2.	The RSSFCA employs the CCF-ADB to achieve automatically region merging, which is superior to the strategy of incorporating local spatial information and helps RSSFCA to achieve better image segmentation than improved FCM algorithms within local spatial information.
